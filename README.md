# Make Abbreviation

Many things in the world consist of several words. We want to create the `makeAbbr()` method that returns their abbreviations. *Will you help us?* Here are examples:

```kotlin
makeAbbr("national aeronautics space administration")
// "NASA"

makeAbbr("central processing unit")
// "CPU"

makeAbbr("simplified molecular input line entry specification")
// "SMILES"
```
